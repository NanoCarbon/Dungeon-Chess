    ## Piece Variety & Upgrades
    - [ ] Create a second type of piece with unique movement/combat rules (e.g., a Rook or Knight variant)  
    ✔ - Consider using dependency injection to add piece behaviors instead of deep inheritance hierarchies @done (3/29/2025, 11:53:27 PM)
    - [ ] Introduce new piece types:  
      ✔ - **Archer (A):** Ranged unit that attacks targets up to 3 squares away @done (3/29/2025, 11:53:58 PM)

      ✔ -  **King:** The primary AI-controlled target with high HP (and balanced for ranged threats) @done (3/29/2025, 11:53:54 PM)
    - [ ] Implement merging mechanics:  
      - [ ] Three basic pawns (default 1 HP) merge into a Super Pawn (with increased HP/attack, and possibly altered movement resembling a knight or bishop)  
      - [ ] Allow further merges to form advanced pieces (e.g., a "horse" with full L-shaped movement, or an upgraded bishop with extra movement options)
    - [ ] Use text styling (capitalization, font colors, or even font type) to visually indicate piece levels/upgrades  
    - [ ] Introduce chance-based "shiny merges" that randomly boost stats or add special effects
